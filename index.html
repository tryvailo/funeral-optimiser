                        <h3>Our Story</h3>
                        <p>ClearFuneralCosts was founded in 2025 following a profoundly difficult year when the founder's wife lost both her parents. During this emotionally overwhelming period, we experienced firsthand the immense challenge of organising funeral arrangements whilst grieving.</p>
                        
                        <p>The financial aspects proved particularly daunting—vast amounts of fragmented information existed, but in moments of acute stress and grief, it was utterly unclear where to turn or how to proceed. We found ourselves making important financial decisions during one of life's most vulnerable moments, without clear guidance or transparent information.</p>
                        
                        <p>That experience planted the seed for ClearFuneralCosts. No family should face this confusion during bereavement.</p>
